## Goal

- Attract more research societies to use and do searches on Botzone.

## Background

Mahjong is an imperfect information four-player game that originated in China with a long history of more than 3000 years. In 1998 the All-China Sports Federation founded a universal competition standard called Chinese Standard Mahjong (Guóbiāo Májiàng in Chinese pronunciation), which we adopt in this competition. However, we reduce 16 games into 1 game on Botzone. 

Mahjong involves strategy and a certain degree of luck, and the uncertainty brings to the game a lot of fun and challenge. Different from Mahjong’s varieties in Asia, e.g., Riichi Mahjong (Japan), Chinese Standard Mahjong encourages the players to adopt aggressive strategies, which makes the competition watchable and attractive.
